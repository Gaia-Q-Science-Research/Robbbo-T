## Design Artifacts

Each domain contains various design artifacts:

- **Requirements Specifications**: Detailed functional and performance requirements
- **3D Models**: CAD models for components, assemblies, and systems
- **2D Drawings**: Technical drawings with dimensions and tolerances
- **Design Specifications**: Detailed design documentation
- **Interface Definitions**: System and component interface specifications
- **Configuration Management**: Design version control and configuration baselines

## Integration with AMPEL360

The CAD-DESIGN pillar integrates with the **AMPEL360** algorithmic design core to:

1. Receive optimized configuration selections from AMPEL360 Phase II (CVaR analysis)
2. Translate mathematical optimization results into detailed design specifications
3. Provide design constraints and feasibility feedback to the optimization process
4. Generate design artifacts ready for detailed engineering analysis (CAE)

## Flow Context

### In CA-DEOPTIMISE Flow
CAD-DESIGN is the starting point where initial concepts are transformed into detailed design specifications.

### In CA-OPTIMISED Flow  
CAD-DESIGN is the culmination where operational experience and improvements are synthesized into evolved design principles for the next generation.
