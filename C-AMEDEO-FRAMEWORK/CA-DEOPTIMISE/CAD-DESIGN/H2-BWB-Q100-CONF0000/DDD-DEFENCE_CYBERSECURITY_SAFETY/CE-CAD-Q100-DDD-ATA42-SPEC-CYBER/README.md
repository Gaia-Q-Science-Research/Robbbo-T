# CE-CAD-Q100-DDD-ATA42-SPEC-CYBER

**Configuration Element:** CE-CAD-Q100-DDD-ATA42-SPEC-CYBER  
**ATA Chapter:** ATA42  
**Description:** Cyber  
**Configuration:** H2-BWB-Q100-CONF0000  
**Domain:** DDD

## Overview

This Configuration Element (CE) implements cyber requirements as defined in ATA iSpec 2200 Chapter ATA42 for the hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft.

## S1000D Integration

This CE generates Data Module Codes (DMC) following the pattern:
```
DMC: Q100-ATA42-<DC>-<IC>-<ICV>-<LC>-<ISSUE>
```

Where:
- **MIC:** Q100 (Model Identification Code for H2-BWB)
- **SNS:** ATA42 (Subject Numbering System per ATA)
- **DC:** Disassembly Code (varies by content type)
- **IC/ICV:** Information Code and Variant
- **LC:** Language Code (default: 000 for English)
- **ISSUE:** Issue number per S1000D standards

## Digital Evidence Twin (DET)

All activities within this CE generate DET evidence packs with the pattern:
```
DET:CAD:Q100:ATA42:<ACTIVITY>:V<REV>
```

Example DET events:
- Design model updates
- Analysis runs and results
- Verification activities
- Configuration changes
- Approval workflows

## Technical Scope

Based on ATA Chapter ATA42, this CE covers:

- Requirements definition and traceability
- Design specifications and models
- Interface definitions
- Verification and validation procedures
- Maintenance and operational procedures

## Dependencies

- **AQUA-OS BRIDGE:** Provides deterministic execution environment
- **GAIA AIR RTOS:** Ensures safety-critical partitioning where applicable
- **CADET:** Tracks circularity and sustainability metrics
- **AMPEL360:** Risk-aware design optimization integration

## Deliverables

- [ ] Technical Requirements Specification
- [ ] Interface Control Documents (ICDs)
- [ ] Design Models and Drawings
- [ ] Analysis Reports
- [ ] Verification & Validation Reports
- [ ] Maintenance Procedures
- [ ] S1000D Data Modules
