## Technology Evolution

### In CA-DEOPTIMISE Flow
CAT serves as the central repository where all technology components are developed, validated, and prepared for integration.

### In CA-OPTIMISED Flow
CAT receives feedback from operational experience to evolve and improve existing technology components, creating enhanced versions for future deployments.

## Circular Technology Lifecycle

The CAT pillar embodies the principle that "no technology dies, only transforms" by:

1. **Component Reuse**: Maximizing reuse of proven software and hardware components
2. **Evolutionary Enhancement**: Continuously improving components based on operational feedback
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintaining institutional knowledge through documented code
4. **Standards Compliance**: Ensuring all technology meets aerospace certification requirements
