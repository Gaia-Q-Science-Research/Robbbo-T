# C-AMEDEO Framework
## Circular Assisted Methods for Evolutive Developments and Entangled Operations
*© Amedeo Pelliccia 2025*

The C-AMEDEO Framework is a meta-framework governing the complete aerospace lifecycle through two complementary flows designed to ensure perpetual technology lifecycle where no technology dies, only transforms.

## Framework Structure

The framework is organized into two main flows:

### CA-DEOPTIMISE (Forward Creation Flow)
```
CAD → CAE → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAM → CAI → CAS → CAEV
```
Initial design through service deployment and sustainment, culminating in the `CAEV` phase for evaluation and activation of the next evolutionary cycle.

### CA-OPTIMISED (Restoration & Evolution Flow)
```
CAS → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAI → CAM → CAE → CAD
```
Sustainability-driven restoration and continuous improvement for perpetual value retention.

## Constitutive Pillars (CAX)

- **CAD:** Computer-Aided Design
- **CAE:** Computer-Aided Engineering
- **CAO:** Computer-Aided Organization and Operations
- **CAP:** Computer-Aided Process/Planning/Protecting
- **CAT:** Computer-Aided Technology (Source & Code Systems: SW, HW, AI, Agents, Instruction Library)
- **CAI:** Computer-Aided Integrations
- **CAM:** Computer-Aided Manufacturing
- **CAS:** Computer-Aided Sustainment
- **CAEV:** Computer-Aided Evolution

## Technological Domains

Each applicable pillar is organized into 15 technological domains:

1. **A** - Architectures, Airframes & Aerodynamics
2. **M** - Mechanical, Material & Monitoring
3. **E1** - Environmental Remediation & Circularity
4. **D** - Defence, Cybersecurity & Safety
5. **E2** - Energy & Renewable
6. **O** - Operating Systems, Navigation & HPC
7. **P** - Propulsion & Fuels
8. **E3** - Electronics, Digital & Instruments
9. **L1** - Logistics, Integrated & Blockchain
10. **L2** - Links, Communications, Control & IoT
11. **I** - Infrastructures & Facilities Value Chains
12. **C1** - Cockpit, Cabin & Cargo Systems
13. **C2** - Cryogenics, Quantum Interfaces & Hydrogen Cells
14. **I2** - Intelligent Systems & Onboard AI
15. **A2** - Airports & Adaptations

## Purpose

The C-AMEDEO Framework provides structure ensuring perpetual technology lifecycle through circular development processes. It serves as the overarching governance structure ensuring no technology dies, only transforms.

## Integration with AMPEL360-BWB-Q Program

This framework structure supports the AMPEL360-BWB-Q program objectives:
- **Single source of truth:** The twin + its evidence
- **Determinism + agility:** Safety-critical rigor with rapid iteration
- **Energy-as-Policy:** Measurable −20–40% energy/CO₂ vs baseline (targets)
- **Circular economy:** Perpetual and verifiable lifecycle

## Navigation

- [CA-DEOPTIMISE Flow](./CA-DEOPTIMISE/README.md) - Forward creation flow
- [CA-OPTIMISED Flow](./CA-OPTIMISED/README.md) - Restoration & evolution flow

## Governance

This framework is part of the broader AMPEL360-BWB-Q program and integrates with:
- **AMPEL360**: The Algorithmic Design Core
- **AQUA-OS BRIDGE**: The Unified Digital Backbone
- **GAIA AIR RTOS**: The Certified Real-Time Execution Foundation
- **CADET**: Circularity Assurance by Digital Evolutive Twin
