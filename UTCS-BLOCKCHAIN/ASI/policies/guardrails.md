# ASI Guardrails and Safety Policies

## Purpose
Ensure ASI (Autonomous Sustainable Intelligence) operates within safe, ethical, and technically sound boundaries while maintaining transparency and accountability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Oversight
- ASI **never** auto-executes tokenomics changes
- All proposals require human review and approval
- TekDAO retains ultimate decision authority
- Emergency stop mechanisms available

### 2. Provenance Requirements
- Only official affiliated repositories allowed
- All DET packets must include valid signatures (Ed25519)
- SHA-256 hash integrity verification required
- Audit trail maintained for all scoring decisions

### 3. Data Quality Guards
- Outlier detection (±3σ threshold)
- Minimum evidence thresholds per metric
- Unit validation (SI units required)
- Temporal consistency checks

### 4. Bias Prevention
- Domain balancing to prevent large domain dominance
- Cross-validation across multiple metrics
- Regular weight review and adjustment
- Transparent methodology documentation

### 5. Security Measures
- Rate limiting on scoring computations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of cryptographic signatures
- Access controls on sensitive operations

## Operational Limits

### Scoring Bounds
- Composite scores clamped to reasonable ranges
- Individual metric normalization bounds
- Maximum DET packets per CI/CE (50)
- Minimum namespaces required (1)

### Temporal Constraints
- Lookback window limited to 90 days
- Weekly computation cycles only
- Grace periods for late-arriving evidence
- Cooldown periods for major changes

### Proposal Thresholds
- Weight changes > 20% trigger human review
- New high performers (>90th percentile) flagged
- Cluster emergence (5+ artifacts) requires validation
- All proposals include methodology justification

## Emergency Procedures

### Alert Conditions
- Anomalous scoring patterns detected
- Security signature verification failures
- Unexpected cluster formations
- Resource consumption spikes

### Response Actions
- Automatic computation suspension
- Human operator notification
- Audit log generation
- Rollback to last known good state

## Compliance Framework

### Audit Requirements
- Monthly scoring methodology reviews
- Quarterly bias analysis reports
- Annual security assessments
- Continuous monitoring logs

### Documentation Standards
- All decisions must be traceable
- Methodology changes documented
- Performance metrics tracked
- User impact assessments

## Review and Updates
- Quarterly guardrail effectiveness review
- Annual policy updates
- Stakeholder feedback integration
- Continuous improvement process
