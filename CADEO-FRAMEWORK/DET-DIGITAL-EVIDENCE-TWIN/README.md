# DET - Digital Evidence Twin

The Digital Evidence Twin (DET) represents the immutable data layer of the CADEO framework, generating Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM) logs for every action within the system. This provides full, certifiable traceability suitable for legal evidence and regulatory audits.

## Architecture Overview

The DET system creates an immutable record of every design decision, analysis result, manufacturing step, and operational event throughout the aircraft's lifecycle. This comprehensive digital twin serves as the authoritative source of truth for certification, compliance, and continuous improvement activities.

## Core Principles

### Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM)
- **Immutability:** Once written, records cannot be modified or deleted
- **Cryptographic Integrity:** Each record is cryptographically signed and timestamped
- **Blockchain Backbone:** Distributed ledger technology ensures tamper-proof records
- **Legal Validity:** Records meet legal standards for evidence admissibility

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Design Phase:** Every CAD operation, analysis run, and design decision
- **Manufacturing:** Complete production history with quality checkpoints
- **Operations:** Flight data, maintenance actions, and configuration changes
- **Evolution:** All CA-OPTIMISED flow modifications and improvements
