# CAS-COMPLIANCE - Computer-Aided Sustainment Compliance

This directory contains the compliance assessment and verification activities that initiate the CA-OPTIMISED restoration and evolution flow.

## Purpose and Scope

CAS-COMPLIANCE represents the critical entry point into the CA-OPTIMISED flow, where existing aircraft configurations are comprehensively assessed for restoration potential, regulatory compliance, and evolution readiness.

## Process Overview

The compliance assessment follows a structured approach:
1. **As-Is Verification** - Current state assessment and documentation
2. **Degradation Analysis** - Component condition and remaining life evaluation
3. **Regulatory Compliance** - Airworthiness directive and regulation compliance check
4. **Re-Entry Planning** - Restoration pathway and re-certification requirements

## Key Activities

### As-Is Verification Process
1. **Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)**
   - Complete aircraft inspection and documentation
   - Configuration verification against certified baseline
   - Identification of modifications and deviations
   - Digital Evidence Twin (DET) record creation

2. **Component Degradation Assessment**
   - Structural health monitoring data analysis
   - Non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection
   - Material condition assessment
   - Remaining useful life calculation

3. **Regulatory Compliance Review**
   - Airworthiness Directive (AD) compliance verification
   - Service Bulletin (SB) incorporation status
   - Maintenance program compliance assessment
   - Certification basis review

### Re-Entry Validation Process
1. **Flight Test Program**
   - Re-certification flight test execution
   - Performance validation against original specifications
   - Safety demonstration and validation
   - Digital Evidence Twin (DET) flight data recording

2. **Certification Documentation**
   - Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) application and approval
   - Updated Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM)
   - Revised maintenance program approval
   - Return to service documentation
