# CA-OPTIMISED Flow

This directory contains the **Restoration & Evolution Flow** of the CADEO framework:

`CAS → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAI → CAM → CAI-improve → CAS → CAE → CAD`

## Process Flow Description

The CA-OPTIMISED flow represents the sustainability-driven restoration and evolution cycle, ensuring perpetual value retention and continuous improvement.

## Core Philosophy

The CA-OPTIMISED flow embodies the principle that **"no technology dies, only transforms"**. This circular approach ensures:

- **Continuous value retention** through systematic restoration
- **Evolutionary improvement** rather than replacement
- **Sustainable lifecycle management** with minimal waste
- **Knowledge preservation** and enhancement across generations
