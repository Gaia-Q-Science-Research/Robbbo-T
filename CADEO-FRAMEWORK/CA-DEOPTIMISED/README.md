# CA-DEOPTIMISED Flow

This directory contains the **Forward Creation Flow** of the CADEO framework:

`CAD → CAE → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAI-ind → CAM → CAI → CAS → CAE-post → CAD-Evo`

## Process Flow Description

The CA-DEOPTIMISED flow represents the traditional forward progression from initial design through service deployment, with built-in preparation for lifecycle evolution.
