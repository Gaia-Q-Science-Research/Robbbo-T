## Component Tracking Convention

Each component follows the path convention:
```
H2-BWB-Q100-CONF0000/[TECHNOLOGY_DOMAIN]/[COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE]/[COMPONENT_ITEM]/
```

Example:
```
H2-BWB-Q100-CONF0000/A-ARCHITECTURES_AIRFRAMES_AERODYNAMICS/CA-CAT-Q100-AAA-CONF0000-53-10-CENTER-BODY-BOX/CI-CA-CAT-Q100-AAA-CONF0000-53-10-01-CB-PRIMARY-GRID/
```

## Standards and Compliance

All components include references to applicable:
- **Airworthiness standards**: CS-25, FAR 25, etc.
- **Systems standards**: ARP4754A, DO-178C, etc.
- **Material standards**: MIL-HDBK-17, ASTM, etc.
- **Manufacturing standards**: AS9100D, ISO 9001, etc.
